## About me:

I'm 29-years old. Last five years I worked as a freelancer - wrote articles, made translations, just a little bit of video editing. Before that I worked as a paramedic at hemodialysis department. But all the time I have passion on computers and coding. So that's why I'm here, trying to pass the JS/FE RS School Course for the first time. I have some experience that I engaged on another courses, but it's not enough to land my first junior developer job.
